*Notes*

 - Each module under `js/` contains an `index.js` file which initializes the 
   module "namespace".
 - To launch a different environment, see `main.js`'s `chosenConfiguration`
   variable and its reference to one of the configurations in 
   `js/config/configurations.js`.

## Deploy

The following steps have been tested on Google Cloud tools.
(July 2019)

### Setup

Create a storage bucket, say `notes-123456-client-resources` with bucket-level permissions.

To set permissions to public [[1](#references)], add permission for `allUsers` with *Storage Legacy Object Reader* (no listing necessary).

### Steps

Run the deploy script after setting the environment variable with the
chosen bucket name:

```
NOTES_APP_WEB_CLIENT_RESOURCES_BUCKET=notes-123456-client-resources
./deploy.sh
```

### Clean-up

Remote the storage bucket from your Google Cloud project, or delete your Google Cloud project.

<!-- TODO Review versioning considerations. -->
<!-- TODO Review caching considerations. -->

<!-- Consider doing fake authentication with client-side secret, at first. -->
<!-- TODO Error logging considerations as with Sentry.io -->

## Running locally

To run a basic Web server using Python ([[2](#references)], [[3](#references)]), run the following command in folder containing `index.html`:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

> If you're using Python 3, the command is a bit different.
> It uses `http.server` module instead of `SimpleHTTPServer`.

Visit [`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/) in your 
favorite browser. ðŸ¤—

## Running tests

*Unit tests* can be run by opening [`http://localhost:8000/index.unitTest.html`](http://localhost:8000/index.unitTest.html). âœ“

*Live tests* can be run by opening [`http://localhost:8000/index.liveTest.html`](http://localhost:8000/index.liveTest.html). âœ“

> Follow the above instructions in [Running locally](#running-locally)
> to start a development server in order to load all scripts.

> For live tests, you may refer to the `config`'s `configurations.js` file for
> connecting to an API server.
> *Note*: live tests dirty the database.
