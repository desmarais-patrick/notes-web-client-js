## Deploy

### Setup

Create a storage bucket, say `notes-123456-client-resources` with bucket-level permissions.

To set permissions to public [[1](#references)], add permission for `allUsers` with *Storage Legacy Object Reader* (no listing necessary).

### Steps

Run the deploy script:

```
NOTES_APP_WEB_CLIENT_RESOURCES_BUCKET=notes-123456-client-resources
./deploy.sh
```

### Clean-up

Remote the storage bucket from your Google Cloud project, or delete your Google Cloud project.
